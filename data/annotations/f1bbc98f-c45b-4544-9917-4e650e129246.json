My name is Noah, and today we’re diving into a conversation that’s long overdue: gentrification in South and East Austin, and how we can actually fight back and slow it down with policy.\nIf you’ve lived in Austin for a while, you’ve seen the change: once-affordable, vibrant neighborhoods are now dotted with luxury highrises and high-end brunch spots. I know I have, I’ve lived in South Austin my entire life. South and East Austin neighborhoods once known for their diversity, creativity, and cultural richness are now barely recognizable. And the people who built that culture? They're being pushed out. Displaced with nowhere to go. - In this introduction, I use my personal experience, inclusive language, and an urgent tone to build credibility and emotionally connect with listeners, setting the stage for a critical conversation about gentrification’s impact on my community.\n"

That means every time a developer builds, a portion of those units must be reserved for low- and middle-income residents. \nSecond, we need rent control especially in historically significant neighborhoods that are most at risk in order to protect the culture that they have built over time.\nAnd third, we need financial protections for long-standing small businesses, many of which are being priced out of the very communities they helped shape.\nThese aren't radical ideas, they’re common sense. And other cities have done it. The question is: will Austin step up? - In this section, I use a confident and solution-focused tone, supported by clear, practical proposals and rhetorical questions, to persuade the audience that meaningful policy change is both possible and urgently needed in Austin.\n"

White residents, meanwhile, had more access to stable, wealthier areas. - In this section, I use expert research and demographic evidence to highlight the racial inequalities of gentrification, appealing to logic and justice to deepen the audience’s understanding of who is most harmed by these changes.\n"

Cities like New York, San Francisco, and even Portland, have all found ways to balance growth and equity. And Austin? We’re one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. Developers aren’t going to pack up just because they’re asked to build responsibly, making this outcome we are searching for very realistic.\nIn fact, Austin has a real opportunity right now. Lawmakers have been discussing changes like reducing minimum lot sizes and expediting permits in order to build more homes faster. But volume alone obviously won’t fix affordability. If we just build more luxury condos, we’re still excluding the people who actually need housing. That’s why affordability must be baked into every part of every growth. - In this conclusion, I directly address counterarguments with evidence from other cities, using logic and a hopeful yet firm tone to argue that responsible development and equity can coexist, and that Austin has both the momentum and responsibility to lead the way.\n"
